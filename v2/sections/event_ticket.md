## Creating a Event Ticket "Campaign" for "The Beat Goes On" Event

The **Beat Goes On** pass is straightforward example, the pass is the same for all the persons with the minor diference that each issued pass has it's own redeem code (barcode redeem code).

```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/
```

POST content

```json
{
  "event_ticket": {
    "name": "The Beat Goes On Event",

            "relevant_text": "Welcome! Enjoy the show."
        }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Field hash object format

```json
{
  "key": "name",
  "value": "2 weeks",
  "label": "EXPIRES",
  "behaviour": "fixed"
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description  |
|--------------|------|----------------|
key  | string | Required. A reference key, it must be unique for a campaign.
value  | string | Required. The field's value
label | string | Required. The field's label
behaviour | string | Optional, Options: __fixed__ or __dynamic__. When not set, use __fixed__ as default


#### Understanding behaviour fields (fixed vs dynamic content)

The presentation fields (`primary_fields`, `secondary_fields`, `auxiliary_fields` and `back_fields`) have a `behaviour` attribute. This attribute can have one of two values: `fixed` or `dynamic` _(by default the `behaviour` is set to `fixed`)_.

- fixed

  `fixed` means that the value is `static`: every pass will have the same `label` and `value` for this field.
  So when you call the  `merge` method in the Ruby client this field will be added or overriden (if the field with the same `key` exists) in every pass even if you had previously customized the value per pass. Don't use the type of field for custom fields in your passes eg: __name__, __client id__, __ticket number__ ,etc. This type of _behaviour_ is a good fit for fields that are the same across all passes eg: `event date`, `event location`, `flight number`, etc.

- dynamic

  The `dynamic` _behaviour_ defines the field as a custom updated field that shouldn't be updated on a bulk update when the `merge` method is called.
  This field will only be updated when the user updates that field specifically for that pass. This type of _behaviour_ is a good fit for custom fields like `ticket number`, `user name`, `boarding number`, `seat number`, etc..


### Location hash object format

```json
{
	"altitude": 0.0,
	"latitude": 0.0,
	"longitude": 0.0,
	"relevant_text": "notification to display"
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description  |
|--------------|------|----------------|
altitude  | double | Optional. Altitude, in meters, of the location.
latitude  | double | Required. Latitude, in degrees, of the location.
longitude | double | Required. Longitude, in degrees, of the location.
relevant_text | string | Optional. Text displayed on the lock screen when the pass is currently relevant. For example, a description of the nearby location such as “Store nearby on 1st and Main.”


### Beacon hash object format

```json
{
	"major": 0.0,
	"minor": 0.0,
	"proximity_uuid": "30b5d792-48c9-4f12-80ff-082cae62e80f",
	"relevant_text": "notification to display"
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description  |

major| 16-bit unsigned integer | Optional. Major identifier of a Bluetooth Low Energy location beacon
minor| 16-bit unsigned integer | Optional. Minor identifier of a Bluetooth Low Energy location beacon
proximity_uuid| string | Required. Unique identifier of a Bluetooth Low Energy location beacon
relevant_text| string | Optional. Text displayed on the lock screen when the pass is currently relevant. For example, a description of the nearby


### Barcode hash object format

	"alt_text": "Text shown below the barcode.",
	"format": "pdf417",
	"message": "Message encoded in the barcode."
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description   | Default |

## Updating the "The Beat Goes On" Event Ticket Campaign

Let's imagine that the location of your event changed, and you wish to update all of the campaign's passes. To do so, you will need to issue a PATCH to the following URL with this example payload:

```shell
PATCH /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}
```


```json
{
	"event_ticket": {
	    "secondary_fields": [
	      {
	        "key": "loc",
	        "label": "LOCATION",
	        "value": "Moscone West"
	      }
	    ],
	    "locations": [
	      {
          	"latitude": 38.725488,
             	"longitude": -9.1501,
             	"relevant_text": "Welcome! Enjoy the show."
	      }
	    ]
	}
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "c7aab24b-a076-4e59-885a-726e80ca64e7",
  "name": "The Beat Goes On Event",
  "template_id": "19293ad0-9ecf-4e31-9c07-b555cb276d13",
  "organization_name": "onomecompany",
  "header_fields": [],
  "primary_fields": [
    {
      "key": "event_name",
      "value": "The Beat Goes On",
      "label": "EVENT"
    }
  ],
  "secondary_fields": [
    {
      "key": "loc",
      "value": "Moscone West",
      "label": "LOCATION"
    }
  ],
  "auxiliary_fields": [],
  "back_fields": [],
  "locations": [
    {
      "latitude": 38.725488,
      "longitude": -9.1501,
      "altitude": null,
      "relevant_text": "Welcome! Enjoy the show."
    }
  ],
  "user_info": {},
  "beacons": [],
  "page_url": "http://get.passworks.io/1VtFTG8YwQ",
  "created_at": "2015-03-27T13:08:57Z",
  "updated_at": "2015-03-27T17:49:50Z"
}
```

**NOTE:** The following instructions will reset all the issued passes to the base template, removing the personalization fields from all the issued passes.

The correct way of updating the already issued passes while preserving the custom fields (like the name of the pass owner, for example) is to iterate trough the issued pass collection, by collecting the ids from
`GET /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/passes`

and then [updating each pass](#updating-each-pass) with the fields you wish to change.

Please contact support@passworks.io for advisement on updating a event ticket campaign.

If, however any old passes that had already been generated and you wish to reset them to the new changes,  you **must**, following a campaign update, issue a push POST request:

```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/push
```

Along with this push, you may also, optionally, send in a payload with a push message that will be presented to the users when the update is done, shown on the lock screen.

```json
{
	"event_ticket": {
	    "push_message": "Venue has changed!"
	}
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description   | Default |
|--------------|------|----------------|---------|
push_message | string | Optional. Text shown on the lock screen. | No message sent.

This request will push all existing passes once again, guaranteeing that all that have been downloaded will contain the new changes. Otherwise, there's no guarantee that the users will receive the updated pass.


## Creating a "The Beat Goes On" Event Ticket Pass

You can create a boilerplate pass simply by POSTing to the passes route:

```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/passes
```

If you want to personalize the pass you can supply an hash with the parameters you want to override:


```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/passes/
```

```json
{
	"pass": {
    "back_fields": [
      {
        "key": "validity",
        "label": "VALID FOR",
        "value": "First day only"
      }
    ]
  }
}

## Forcing a push update of a pass

You can force the update of a pass via push notification by simply calling the following URL:

```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/passes/{pass_id}/push
```

You can also send a custom message that will be displayed in the lock screen via push notification sending the following content in the above request

```json
{
	"event_ticket": {
	    "push_message": "Venue has changed!"
	}
}
```

## Redeeming a pass

There are two ways you can redeem a pass:

- Redeeming a pass by referencing a redeem code
	You can redeem a pass by referencing a redeem code (instead of the pass_id) by POSTing to the campaign `redeem` route

	```shell
	/v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/redeem
	```
	Issuing a payload with a root element `pass` and with the redeem code in the payload:

	```json
	{
		"pass": {
			"redeem_code": "0000001",
			"comment": "Redeemed in store"
		}
	}
	```
	The method accepts an optional `comment` key where you can specify some information you want to be stored for reference.


- Redeem a pass directly
	You can redeem a pass directly, by POSTing to the pass `redeem` route:

	```shell
	POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/passes/{pass_id}/redeem
	```

	You can supply an optional `comment` key where you can specify some information you want to be stored for reference:

	```json
	{
		"pass": {
			"comment": "redeemed in store"
		}
	}
	```

## Aditional routes available

### Get all the Event Ticket campaigns:
```shell
GET /v2/event_tickets/
```

### Delete a Event Ticket campaign

```shell
DELETE /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}
```

In case of success a HTTP 200 status code is returned with empty error list.
n
```json
{
  "errors": []
}
```

In case of a error a HTTP 412 (Precondition Failed) status code is returned with a array of errors.

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "campaign": "Campaign not found."
  }
}
```

### Changing campaign state via PAUSE, RESUME, ARCHIVE

You can pause, resume and archive campaigns using the following endpoints:

Pausing a campaign disables the ability to issue more passes and changes the campaign state to "paused".

```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/pause
```

Resuming a campaign re-enables the issuing of new passes, changes the campaign state to "published" again.

```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/resume
```

Archiving stops the issuing of new passes and and hides the campaign from the interface without deleting the campaign. It changes the campaign state to "archived".

```shell
POST /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/archive
```

If the campaign state is changed successfully the endpoints return a 200 HTTP status code.

In case of a error a HTTP 412 (Precondition Failed) is returned with a error message, eg:

```
{
  "errors": [
    "Can't resume from archived to publish"
  ]
}
```

### Get all the passes for a specific Event Ticket campaign:
```shell
GET /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/passes
```

### Get a pass's id from its redeem code
```shell
GET /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/redeem/{redeem_code}
```

### Reports
```shell
GET /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/reports
```

```shell
GET /v2/event_tickets/{campaign_id}/reports/totals
```
