## Creating a Coupon Campaign for "Paw Planet" Store

We are going to assume that Paw Planet is going to use sequencial barcodes, in this case each barcode numbering will be unique and is going to start from 1.

```shell
POST /v2/coupons/
```

Payload

```json
{
  "coupon": {
    "name": "Paw Planet",
    "icon_id": "ffe0d88f-916d-4a12-8244-9ecd0178ca45",
    "barcode": {
      "format": "pdf417"
    },

      {
        "longitude": -122.3748889,
        "latitude": 37.6189722
      }
    ],

    ]
  }
}
```

Response:

| list  | Not used in the API for now. |
| per_pass | This means that per pass creation request you need to supply the barcode message that will be used |


### Field hash object format

```json
{
  "key": "name",
  "value": "2 weeks",
  "label": "EXPIRES",
  "behaviour": "fixed"
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description  |
|--------------|------|----------------|
key  | string | Required. A reference key, it must be unique for a campaign.
value  | string | Required. The field's value
label | string | Required. The field's label
behaviour | string | Optional, Options: __fixed__ or __dynamic__. When not set, use __fixed__ as default


#### Understanding behaviour fields (fixed vs dynamic content)

The presentation fields (`primary_fields`, `secondary_fields`, `auxiliary_fields` and `back_fields`) have a `behaviour` attribute. This attribute can have one of two values: `fixed` or `dynamic` _(by default the `behaviour` is set to `fixed`)_.

- fixed

  `fixed` means that the value is `static`: every pass will have the same `label` and `value` for this field.
  So when you call the  `merge` method in the Ruby client this field will be added or overriden (if the field with the same `key` exists) in every pass even if you had previously customized the value per pass. Don't use the type of field for custom fields in your passes eg: __name__, __client id__, __ticket number__ ,etc. This type of _behaviour_ is a good fit for fields that are the same across all passes eg: `event date`, `event location`, `flight number`, etc.

- dynamic

  The `dynamic` _behaviour_ defines the field as a custom updated field that shouldn't be updated on a bulk update when the `merge` method is called.
  This field will only be updated when the user updates that field specifically for that pass. This type of _behaviour_ is a good fit for custom fields like `ticket number`, `user name`, `boarding number`, `seat number`, etc..

### Location hash object format

```json
{
  "altitude": 0.0,
  "latitude": 0.0,
  "longitude": 0.0,
  "relevant_text": "notification to display"
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description  |
|--------------|------|----------------|
altitude  | double | Optional. Altitude, in meters, of the location.
latitude  | double | Required. Latitude, in degrees, of the location.
longitude | double | Required. Longitude, in degrees, of the location.
relevant_text | string | Optional. Text displayed on the lock screen when the pass is currently relevant. For example, a description of the nearby location such as “Store nearby on 1st and Main.”


### Beacon hash object format

```json
{
  "major": 0.0,
  "minor": 0.0,
  "proximity_uuid": "30b5d792-48c9-4f12-80ff-082cae62e80f",
  "relevant_text": "notification to display"
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description  |
|--------------|------|----------------|
major| 16-bit unsigned integer | Optional. Major identifier of a Bluetooth Low Energy location beacon
minor| 16-bit unsigned integer | Optional. Minor identifier of a Bluetooth Low Energy location beacon
proximity_uuid| string | Required. Unique identifier of a Bluetooth Low Energy location beacon
relevant_text| string | Optional. Text displayed on the lock screen when the pass is currently relevant. For example, a description of the nearby

### Barcode hash object format

## Updating the "Paw Planet" Coupon Campaign

Updating a campaign is a two phase operation, first you need to update the campaign with the desired changes, and then you need to push the changes to all passes.

### Updating the campaign

Here is an simple example on how to update the `offer` and `expire` fields of the previous campaign.

```shell
PATCH /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}
```


```json
{
  "coupon": {
    "primary_fields": [
      {
        "key": "offer",
        "label": "Any cat or dog treats",
        "value": "30% off"
      }
    ],
    "auxiliary_fields": [
      {
        "key": "expires",
        "label": "EXPIRES",
        "value": "3 days"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "5fd663d1-4ed4-4800-8d5a-caea4131358a",
  "name": "Paw Planet",
  "template_id": "9bd46ecb-20c8-41cb-a8d8-f848a07c220c",
  "organization_name": "your company",
  "barcode": {
    "format": "qrcode",
    "message": "",
    "alt_text": ""
  },
  "allow_multiple_redeems": false,
  "header_fields": [],
  "primary_fields": [
    {
      "key": "offer",
      "value": "30% off",
      "label": "Any cat or dog treats"
    }
  ],
  "secondary_fields": [],
  "auxiliary_fields": [
    {
      "key": "expires",
      "value": "3 days",
      "label": "EXPIRES"
    }
  ],
  "back_fields": [],
  "locations": [
    {
      "latitude": 37.6189722,
      "longitude": -122.3748889,
      "altitude": null,
      "relevant_text": null
    }
  ],
  "beacons": [],
  "page_url": "http://get.passworks.io/I5dPyf_j2Q",
  "pkpass_url": "http://get.passworks.io/I5dPyf_j2Q.pkpass",
  "page_short_url": "https://pass.yt/p/z62",
  "pkpass_short_url": "https://pass.yt/p/z62.pkpass",  
  "created_at": "2015-03-31T18:01:44Z",
  "updated_at": "2015-03-31T18:22:50Z"
}

```


### Pushing the changes to the passes

Now we need to push the changes to the existing passes of the campaign and if we wish we can also send a "push message" with the update at the same time.

```shell
POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/merge
```


```json
  {
      "push_message": "30% off for the next 3 days!"
  }
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description   | Default |
|--------------|------|----------------|---------|
push_message | string | Optional. Text shown on the lock screen. | No message sent.


Sending the `push_message` attribute in the body of the request is optional, if you leave the body request (POST) empty the passes will be updated and pushed to the users device without displaying any push message.

This request will push all existing passes once again, guaranteeing that all that have been downloaded will contain the new changes. Otherwise, there's no guarantee that the users will receive the updated pass.

NOTE:

Special considerations, dynamic fields values of the passes will be left unchanged by the merge, this means that the merge will update the passes with the new layout, field labels, geo-location fields, etc but will let the custom fields values untouched.

Now that you've updated your campaign, all the future passes generated from this updated campaign will contain the new changes.


### Forcing passes sync and sending push messages

You can send a "push message" to all customers calling the "push" endpoint, this will force the customers wallets to fetch the latest version of the pass and send send an attached push message if defined.

```shell
POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/push
```

Along with this push, you may also, optionally, send in a payload with a push message that will be presented to the users when the update is done, shown on the lock screen.

```json
{
  "coupon": {
      "push_message": "New promotion!"
  }
}
```

|  Field name  | Type |  Description   | Default |
|--------------|------|----------------|---------|
push_message | string | Optional. Text shown on the lock screen. | No message sent.

This request will push all existing passes once again, guaranteeing that all that have been downloaded will contain the new changes. Otherwise, there's no guarantee that the users will receive the updated pass.


## Creating a "Paw Planet" Coupon Pass

You can create a boilerplate pass simply by POSTing to the passes route:

```shell
POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/passes
```

If you want to personalize the pass you can supply an hash with the parameters you want to override:


```shell
POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/passes/
```

```json
{
  "pass": {}
}
```

Response:

```json

PATCH /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/passes/{pass_id}
```


```json
{
  "pass": {
    "primary_fields": [
      {
        "key": "offer",

```


## Forcing a push update of a pass

You can force the update of a pass via push notification by simply calling the following URL:

```shell
POST /v2/coupon/{campaign_id}/passes/{pass_id}/push
```

You can also send a custom message that will be displayed in the lock screen via push notification sending the following content in the above request

```json
{
  "pass": {
      "push_message": "Special offer just for you!"
  }
}
```


## Redeeming a pass

There are two ways you can redeem a pass:

- Redeeming a pass by referencing a redeem code
	You can redeem a pass by referencing a redeem code (instead of the pass_id) by POSTing to the campaign `redeem` route

	```shell
	/v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/redeem
	```
	Issuing a payload with a root element `pass` and with the redeem code in the payload:

	```json
	{
		"pass": {
			"redeem_code": "0000001",
			"comment": "Redeemed in store"
		}
	}
	```
	The method accepts an optional `comment` key where you can specify some information you want to be stored for reference.


- Redeem a pass directly
	You can redeem a pass directly, by POSTing to the pass `redeem` route:

	```shell
	POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/passes/{pass_id}/redeem
	```

	You can supply an optional `comment` key where you can specify some information you want to be stored for reference:

	```json
	{
		"pass": {
			"comment": "redeemed in store"
		}
	}
	```

### Changing campaign state via PAUSE, RESUME, ARCHIVE

You can pause, resume and archive campaigns using the following endpoints:

Pausing a campaign disables the ability to issue more passes and changes the campaign state to "paused".

```shell
POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/pause
```

Resuming a campaign re-enables the issuing of new passes, changes the campaign state to "published" again.

```shell
POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/resume
```

Archiving stops the issuing of new passes and and hides the campaign from the interface without deleting the campaign. It changes the campaign state to "archived".

```shell
POST /v2/coupons/{campaign_id}/archive
```

If the campaign state is changed successfully the endpoints return a 200 HTTP status code.

In case of a error a HTTP 412 (Precondition Failed) is returned with a error message, eg:

```
{
  "errors": [
    "Can't resume from archived to publish"
  ]
}
```

### Get a pass's id from its redeem code

```
